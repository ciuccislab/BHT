## Description
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most widely used experimental tools in electrochemistry and has applications ranging from energy storage and power generation to medicine. Considering the broad applicability of the EIS technique, it is critical to validate the EIS data against the Hilbert transform (HT) or, equivalently, the Kramersâ€“Kronig relations. These mathematical relations allow one to assess the self-consistency of obtained spectra. However, the use of validation tests is still uncommon. In the present article, we aim at bridging this gap by reformulating the HT under a Bayesian framework. In particular, we developed the Bayesian Hilbert transform (BHT) method that interprets the HT probabilistically. Leveraging the BHT, we proposed several scores that provide quick metrics for the evaluation of the EIS data quality.

## Tutorials

* **ex1_ZARC.ipynb**: this tutorial illustrates how the BHT-DRT works using a simple ZARC model.
* **ex2_two-ZARCs.ipynb**: this tutorial is similar to the above one, but with a more complicated model, i.e., two-ZARCs model.
* **ex3_drift.ipynb**: in this tutorial, we evaluate the BHT-DRT performance with the EIS spectrum that has a drift. The drift is imposed on the polarization resistance. 
* **ex4_MoS2_exp.ipynb**: in this example tutorial, we demonstrate that the BHT-DRT is also available for the unbounded impedance, e.g., the impedance data for a sodium ion battery. 
* **ex5_failed.ipynb**: the last tutorial shows how the BHT-DRT is able to detect the inconsistency of the impedance data.
